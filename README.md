# MancalaBoardGame

Mancala is a two-player strategy board game in which a handful of gemstones are distributed around the board. This project models Mancala in Java, using the Swing library for GUI. It applies object-oriented principles and the Model View Controller pattern by separating the game logic and the GUI.
